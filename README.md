## Background
My name is Matthew Newkirk! I wrote a longer background of myself, but I failed to save it correctly while working within the ZIP folder. So this has been a good practice exercise. I have BA in the Humanities from Eastern Washington University, with minors in Computer Science and Philosophy. Since graduating I have worked a job that has underutilized my skills and limit my potential.

My current career goal is to develop a portfolio of skills that will enable me to launch a new career in technology.

I chose UW's FinTech as it seemed like a novel opportunity to learn coding and finance simultaneously andf thus maximize my learning.
